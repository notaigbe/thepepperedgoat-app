This could involve displaying saved card details and providing options to add new cards or edit existing ones.\n*   **Order History:** Fetch and display the user's order history in a clear and organized manner. Consider using pagination or infinite scrolling to handle a large number of orders efficiently.\n*   **Profile Image Upload:** Add an image upload component that allows users to select and upload a profile picture. Optimize the image for display and storage.\n\n**Targeted Notifications:**\n\n*   **Notification System:** Implement a notification system that can send targeted messages to users based on their RSVP status and app usage. This could involve integrating with a push notification service and creating an admin interface for composing and sending notifications.\n*   **Event RSVP:** Modify the event registration process to trigger notifications upon successful RSVP and slot confirmation.\n\n**Data Handling:**\n\n*   **API Endpoints:** Create or update API endpoints to handle payment information updates, order history retrieval, and profile image uploads.\n*   **Data Storage:** Store payment information securely (using tokenization or encryption), order history, and profile image URLs in the database.\n\nTo proceed, I recommend enabling Supabase to handle the backend functionalities such as database storage, authentication, and potentially push notifications. Please enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button and connecting to a project.
